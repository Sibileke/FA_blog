How do you get a job? Well, people say you write a CV and start applying. And where do you apply? On online job boards. Before online job boards became a thing, you'd have to fax or send in your applications by mail. Today, you can do it from the comfort of your home. While applying to jobs on job boards is not the only way to get a job—or should I say increase your chance of getting a job—it's the common one and usually the first thing that comes to mind for most people.

**The Problem with Job Boards**

There are lots of places to search for jobs today: LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, FlexJobs, Monster, and the list goes on and on. The average application can take anywhere between 10 to 25 minutes, depending on the nature of the job. Hence the rise of things like "easy apply" and "one-click apply." Even this approach doesn't solve the stress job seekers face when trying to increase their chances of applying to multiple jobs.

The problems include:

- Keeping track of all these jobs they have applied to and where.
- Ensuring they read the application thoroughly before applying to these jobs.
- Answering repetitive questions.
- Knowing whether they are a good fit for the job or not.

Going through all of this for each job application can be a pain.

For this sole reason, this is why we built FlashApply. There is no doubt that AI is everywhere, but wouldn't it be cool if you could have your own personal AI assistant that helps you with job search and application?

**Introducing FlashApply**

FlashApply is an AI agent that crawls the web for new opportunities matching your preferences. You tell the AI what kind of job you are looking for, and you let it handle the rest. FlashApply goes out there, finds the job, and helps you apply to these companies.

"Hold on a minute," you may say, "don't I have a say in which and what companies it should apply to?" Yes, you do have a say. You can run FlashApply in two modes: one is Copilot, which means it will

- Find the opportunity.
- Answer all questions for that listing.
- And put it in a state for you to review.

You can then review and approve which job gets sent to the company.

The alternative is Autopilot, which will automatically send the job without needing your review.

**How does it know how to answer the questions asked during the job application?** Simple. When you onboard and go through the basic questions and upload your resume, we use this to build a knowledge base about you. For every job application, the size of your knowledge base keeps increasing so that your personal AI assistant understands you better.

**Can I use FlashApply now?**

Absolutely, at the time of writing, FlashApply is in public beta and ready for use, and feel free to give it a try. Our goal is to change the way people apply for jobs.
