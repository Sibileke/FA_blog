**Embracing Automation**

Times have changed. AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are on the rise, taking over various aspects of our daily lives, and we are here to empower you with the tools you need to harness this change.

Recruiters have embraced automation as a standard practice, so why shouldn't job seekers or contractors? This is precisely why we are building FlashApply â€“ your personal job application assistant. It offers an unfair advantage in a highly competitive and stress-filled job market.

We invite you to join us as we share every step of our journey in building the future of job applications. Going forward, we will maintain a public weekly journal documenting our progress at every step of this journey. We encourage you to join us and [share feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeresOcDCv8fbnw6AiBD7uDUigM6F6n0TF4XRm2778_HGiZmg/viewform) as we turn this vision into reality.

Yours truly,

Team FlashApply
